## Project Description

The Poultry Disease Classification Project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies poultry diseases based on images of fecal matter. The primary objective is to assist poultry farmers and veterinarians in the early detection of diseases, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.

The model is designed to recognize four specific categories of poultry diseases:
- **Cocci**: Coccidiosis in poultry.
- **Healthy**: Indicating no signs of disease.
- **NCD (Newcastle Disease)**: A viral infection that affects poultry.
- **Salmonella**: A bacterial infection commonly found in poultry.

Using a hybrid architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-head Self Attention (MSA), the project processes images through a robust preprocessing pipeline to enhance classification accuracy.

In addition to the classification model, the project includes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot that provides users with information and remedies related to the detected diseases. After an image is classified, the RAG bot retrieves relevant data and generates helpful responses, aiding farmers in understanding disease management strategies.

This comprehensive tool aims to improve the overall health of poultry, optimize management practices in the industry, and empower farmers with knowledge for better decision-making.
